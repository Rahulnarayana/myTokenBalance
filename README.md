# Token Dashboard - React Application

This is a simple React application to interact with a token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet. Users can check their token balance, transfer tokens, and sign an agreement using EIP-712.

## Project Overview

The application integrates various Web3 functionalities including:
- Displaying token balances
- Transferring tokens to other addresses
- Signing terms and conditions using EIP-712
- Wallet interaction via Web3 libraries (Wagmi, Ethers.js)

The token contract is deployed on the **Binance Smart Chain Testnet**.

## Contract Information

- **Contract Address**: `0xYourTokenContractAddressHere`
- **Token Symbol**: `YourTokenSymbol`
- **Token Decimals**: `6` (for example)
- **Blockchain**: Binance Smart Chain Testnet (BSC Testnet)
- **Explorer**: [BSC Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.bscscan.com/)

## Features

- **Transfer Tokens**: Users can transfer tokens to any address.
- **Balance Display**: Users can see their current token balance.
- **EIP-712 Agreement Signing**: Users must agree to terms and conditions by signing a message before transferring tokens.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (Recommended version: 16.x or later)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/token-dashboard.git
   cd token-dashboard
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure the Token Contract: Ensure the TOKEN_ADDRESS and TOKEN_ABI are correctly set in src/utils/tokenConfig.js with the details of your deployed contract on the BSC Testnet.

Example:

js
Copy code
export const TOKEN_ADDRESS = '0xYourTokenContractAddressHere';
export const TOKEN_ABI = [ /* Your ABI here */ ];
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.


### Key Points to Modify:

1. **Token Contract Information**: Replace `0xYourTokenContractAddressHere` with your actual deployed token contract address.
2. **ABI**: Make sure you provide the correct ABI for your token contract in the `TOKEN_ABI` variable.
3. **Faucet**: Mention the correct faucet link to obtain test tokens for the Binance Smart Chain Testnet, if necessary.

This README will provide users with all the necessary details to set up and use your application effectively.
